# Auth Pages

## Overview

The Auth Pages in the Second Opinion application handle user authentication processes including login, registration, password reset, and account verification. These pages are crucial for securing user data and providing personalized experiences.

## Expected Structure

In the Next.js App Router pattern, authentication pages would typically be organized in the following location:

```
client/src/app/(auth)/[auth-page-name]/page.js
```

Where `(auth)` is a route group that doesn't affect the URL path but helps organize related routes, and `[auth-page-name]` represents specific authentication pages like login, register, etc.

## Implemented Auth Pages

The application currently includes the following auth pages:

- **Login Page**: User authentication with email/password (`/login`)
- **Registration Page**: New user account creation (`/register`)
- **Forgot Password Page**: Password recovery process (`/forgot-password`)
- **Email Verification Page**: Verifying user email addresses (`/verify-email`)

## Future Auth Pages

Additional auth pages that may be implemented in the future:

- **Reset Password Page**: Setting a new password
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Additional security layer (optional)

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing authentication pages, developers should follow these guidelines:

- Use Client Components for forms with interactive elements
- Implement proper form validation for all input fields
- Follow security best practices for handling credentials
- Provide clear error messages and success feedback
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Implement proper redirection after authentication actions
- Use secure HTTP-only cookies for session management

## Authentication Flow

The typical authentication flow will include:

1. User navigates to login/register page
2. User submits credentials
3. Server validates credentials
4. On success, user receives authentication token
5. User is redirected to protected routes

## Related Components

These pages will likely utilize shared components from:

```
client/src/components/auth/
```

## Security Considerations

- Implement CSRF protection
- Use HTTPS for all authentication requests
- Rate limit authentication attempts
- Implement proper password hashing
- Consider implementing OAuth for social login options
