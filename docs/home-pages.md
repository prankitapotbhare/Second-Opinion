# Home Pages

## Overview

The home pages in the Second Opinion application serve as the entry points for users. These pages are built using Next.js App Router, which is a file-system based router built on top of React Server Components. The home pages are crucial for providing users with their first impression of the application and guiding them to the appropriate sections.

## Structure

In the Next.js App Router pattern, the home page is defined in:

```
client/src/app/page.js
```

This file exports a React component named `Home` which renders the main landing page of the application.

## Key Features

- **Landing Page**: The main entry point for users visiting the application
- **Navigation**: Links to documentation and deployment options
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with mobile-first approach

## Implementation Details

The home page is implemented as a React Server Component, which allows for server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO. It uses:

- Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom font configuration (Geist Sans and Geist Mono)

- `client/src/app/layout.js`: Defines the root layout that wraps the home page
- `client/src/app/globals.css`: Contains global styles used across the application

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the home pages include:

- Adding more interactive elements
- Implementing feature highlights
- Integrating user testimonials
- Adding call-to-action sections for new users
