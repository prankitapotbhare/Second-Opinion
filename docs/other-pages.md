# Other Pages

## Overview

The "Other Pages" section of the Second Opinion application encompasses all non-home and non-authentication pages that provide specific functionality to users. These pages are designed to deliver various features and content throughout the application. This includes specific pages like page1, page2, etc. that serve different purposes within the application.

## Expected Structure

In the Next.js App Router pattern, other pages would typically be organized in the following locations:

```
client/src/app/[page-name]/page.js
```

Where `[page-name]` represents the route segment for each specific page.

## Anticipated Pages

While these pages are not yet implemented, the application is expected to include:

### Standard Pages
- **About Page**: Information about the Second Opinion service and its mission
- **Contact Page**: Contact information and form for user inquiries
- **FAQ Page**: Frequently asked questions and answers
- **Services Page**: Details about the medical opinion services offered
- **Pricing Page**: Information about service pricing and plans
- **Blog/Articles**: Medical information and educational content
- **User Dashboard**: Once authenticated, users can access their dashboard

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these pages, developers should follow these guidelines:

- Use Next.js App Router conventions for routing
- Implement as React Server Components where appropriate for better performance
- Use Client Components for interactive elements
- Maintain consistent styling with the rest of the application
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Follow accessibility best practices

## Related Components

These pages will likely utilize shared components from:

```
client/src/components/
```

## Future Development

As the application evolves, additional pages may be added based on user needs and business requirements. The structure should remain flexible to accommodate growth while maintaining organization and consistency.
