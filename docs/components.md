# Components

## Overview

Components in the Second Opinion application are reusable UI elements that provide consistent functionality and appearance throughout the application. These components help maintain design consistency, improve development efficiency, and enhance the user experience.

## Expected Structure

Components are typically organized in the following location:

```
client/src/components/
```

Within this directory, components should be further organized by category or functionality:

```
client/src/components/
  ├── common/         # Shared components used across multiple pages
  ├── layout/         # Layout components like headers, footers, sidebars
  ├── ui/             # Basic UI components like buttons, inputs, cards
  ├── auth/           # Components specific to authentication
  ├── forms/          # Form-related components
  ├── dashboard/      # Components used in user dashboard
  └── [feature]/      # Feature-specific components
```

Note: The components directory is currently empty but will be populated according to this structure as development progresses.

## Component Categories

### Common Components

These are shared across multiple pages and provide consistent functionality:

- **Header**: Application navigation and branding
- **Footer**: Site information, links, and copyright
- **Sidebar**: Secondary navigation or contextual information
- **Modal**: Overlay windows for focused interactions
- **Notification**: Toast or alert messages

### UI Components

Basic building blocks for the user interface:

- **Button**: Various button styles and states
- **Input**: Text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons
- **Card**: Content containers with consistent styling
- **Badge**: Small status indicators
- **Avatar**: User profile images
- **Dropdown**: Selection menus
- **Tabs**: Content organization with tabbed interface

### Form Components

Components specific to form handling:

- **Form**: Container with validation logic
- **FormField**: Input field with label and error handling
- **Checkbox**: Toggle selection component
- **RadioGroup**: Exclusive selection options
- **Select**: Dropdown selection component
- **DatePicker**: Date selection component

### Auth Components

Components specific to authentication:

- **LoginForm**: User login interface
- **RegisterForm**: New user registration
- **PasswordReset**: Password recovery interface
- **OTPInput**: One-time password input for 2FA

## Implementation Guidelines

When creating components, developers should follow these guidelines:

- Use TypeScript for type safety when possible
- Implement proper prop validation
- Create responsive components that work on all screen sizes
- Follow accessibility (ARIA) best practices
- Write unit tests for component functionality
- Document component props and usage examples
- Use consistent naming conventions

## Component Architecture

Components should follow these architectural principles:

- **Composability**: Components should be easily combined
- **Reusability**: Design for reuse across the application
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component should do one thing well
- **Encapsulation**: Internal state should be properly contained
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent API and behavior

## Future Development

As the application evolves, the component library will grow. Maintaining documentation and ensuring consistent usage patterns will be essential for scalability and maintainability.
